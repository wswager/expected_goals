# Milwaukee Rampage FC
***
Milwaukee Rampage FC are a returning professional soccer club looking to form a professional women's team to enter into the second-tier of US Women's Soccer, [United Women's Soccer (UWS)](https://uwssoccer.com/).

Milwaukee Rampage FC was founded in 1993 and formerly operated a men's professional team in the second-tier of US Soccer, first in the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), from 1994 to 1996, then in the A-League, from 1996 to 2002.

Due to the success of the [Chicago Red Stars](https://www.chicagoredstars.com/) sustaining a team in the US Women's first-tier, the [National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)](www.nwslsoccer.com), since 2013, Milwaukee Rampage FC feel the Milwaukee market is well positioned to support a second-tier team, with hopes of future expansion into the NWSL as the sport grows within the US.

Milwaukee Rampage FC are in the process of building their support staff and infrastructure and have requested support for the training staff by a data science department, with the goal of helping the team achieve maximum efficiency, allowing for maximum success and entertainment value on the field while controlling costs, primarily in player acquisition and salaries.

With this goal in mind, Milwaukee Rampage FC have requested an expected goals model which can help predict the likelihood of goals based on available data, which the training staff can utilize to analyze game data and provide actionable insights on the training ground for players on how to increase the likelihood of goals.

## Expected Goals (xG)
***
xG is a commonly referred to metric within soccer used to represent the probability a scoring opportunity may result in a goal.

xG is not a standardized metric, and therefore various data science companies, betting organizations, and teams build their own proprietary models to predict xG.

## Data
